Java HTTP Proxy Library (http://wpg-proxy.sourceforge.net/)

Java Library to assist in recording and troubleshooting http by providing an 
implementation of a proxy and having extensible classes to handle post/pre 
processing which can be used to carry out custom actions or logging of the 
transactions.

Build Instructions
==================

To build wpg-proxy you will need to retrieve the JAR dependencies (see Ivy
Installation below) by issuing 

ant libs

from within the directory where the project build.xml is located.  If you
prefer not to use Ivy then downloads the JARs identified in the ivy.xml
file and place them yourself into the lib directory of this project.

The wpg-proxy JAR itself can be built by issuing

ant compile

and documentation by issuing

and docs


Ivy Installation
================

Ivy is a dependency manager that retrieves/resolves JAR dependencies and 
keeps copies thereof in a local cache (usually ~/.ivy/)  You can find 
out more about ivy and download it from:

http://incubator.apache.org/ivy/

Once ivy is installed you will need to add the ivy.jar to your CLASSPATH
(this jar is usually located in ~/.ivy/jars/ivy.jar)
